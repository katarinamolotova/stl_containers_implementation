# stl_containers_implementation

Teaching team project. Implemented in a team of two people.
Team: [teammate: Katarina Molotova](https://github.com/katarinamolotova)

The project has implemented its own library that implements the basic standard C++ container classes: `list`, `map`, `queue`, `set`, `stack` and `vector`. The implementation provides a full set of standard methods and attributes for element processing, container capacity testing, and iteration. As a bonus, several other container classes from the C++ Container Library are implemented that are not as commonly used but differ in implementation details (`multi-set`, `array`).
